**Project Description:**
My project is to build a digital metronome. A metronome is a tool used to keep a certain tempo in a number of activities. The majority of people that use metronomes are musicians that strive to increase their speed, accuracy, or to just practice playing a certain tempo. It works by creating a regular aural pulse that a user can then subdivide into different tempos. For example, sixteenth-note triplets would mean each beat is divided into 6 pieces. The metronome is a very useful tool for obtaining proficiency with any instrument.


**Technologies:**

QML, Qt, C++, JavaScript

Send me an email regarding your thoughts and ideas, what you would add, remove, modify, etc.

**Credits, Inspiration, Alternatives:**

The inspiration for this application was to create an application that I could actually use for myself. As an avid guitar player, I was interested in building in a tool that would help increase my technical proficiency at guitar playing. In addition, by creating this as free software and posting it on GitHub, many more software-oriented guitar players can benefit from this application.
